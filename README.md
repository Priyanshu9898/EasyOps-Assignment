## Live Website: https://frontend-assignment-alpha.vercel.app/

## Project Description:

    The Contact Management App is a simple, yet powerful web application that allows users to manage their personal contacts. This application is built using React and uses the browser's local storage for data persistence.

    The Contact Management App provides an intuitive user interface for managing personal contacts. Users can add new contacts, search for existing ones, sort the contact list, and delete contacts. The app also ensures that contact names and numbers are unique, so there are no duplicates.## Technologies Used
- React
- Local Storage
- HTML
- CSS



## Features

    1. Add Contacts
    Users can add new contacts by entering their first name, last name, and contact number in the provided form. All fields are mandatory to ensure complete and accurate contact information.

    2. Search Contacts
    Users can search for existing contacts by typing a query in the search bar. The search function is case-insensitive and filters contacts based on their first name or last name.

    3. Sort Contacts
    The application allows users to sort the contact list by name. By clicking on the Name column header, users can toggle between ascending and descending order.

    4. Delete Contacts
    Users can delete a contact by clicking the "Delete" button next to the corresponding contact. The app displays an alert to confirm the deletion.

    5. Data Persistence
    The Contact Management App uses the browser's local storage to store contact data, ensuring that the information remains available even after closing the browser or refreshing the page.

    6. Responsive Design
    The application is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience across various platforms.

    7. Basic Styling
    The app features simple yet clean styling to enhance user experience.
